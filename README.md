# UFO's Summary
      The Summary of this project to display the filtered data in the table form, Where as there is one drawback in this design which is when we enter the each field/table value the table is getting filtered and also we have to know all the search data before(for example we have to all the possible shapes to search in shape field). And the recommendations are If we add search or submit or filter butten, first let the user enter the data in all the fields and then click the button. And the other recommendation is if we provide a drop down list to all the labal fields that it would be more easier for user to enter the data.
